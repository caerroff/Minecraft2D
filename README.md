## <center>Minecraft, But in 2D, coded in C</center>

### <center>So not really minecraft anymore...</center>

# What's the purpose ?
 We don't really know yet, but it's gonna be fun.

# Compiling
 To compile, we recommend using gcc or cc, which are both included with *every* Linux Distro

 You can use it like so:
 
   <center>`gcc *.c -o MC2D`</center>
 
 and then run the program with
 
   <center>`./MC2D`</center>

if you don't have gcc or cc, you can use a regular IDE, and compile the code, linking every `.c` file.

##### *A Makefile has been created too, so if you can just type make in the game's directory and it'll do all the bad work*

# File Structure
  The file structure is pretty straight-forward, `GUI.c` is the **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface, `Physics.c` are the functions calculating gravity etc...
  If you have any question on the code, or would like to give suggestions, we would be glad to hear them, write us
  
  **Faut trouver une adresse email haha...*

# Can I re-use the code?
  **Yes !**

  Just credit the code you re-use, and you're free to go. 
<small>*By the way, if you do anything with it, we'd be glad to see what it is, even though it is not mendatory.*</small>
